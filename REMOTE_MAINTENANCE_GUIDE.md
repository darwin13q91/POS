# Remote Maintenance System - Usage Guide

The Remote Maintenance System provides comprehensive support and monitoring capabilities for your POS system, enabling remote diagnostics, updates, support ticketing, and system health monitoring.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Initialization
The system is automatically initialized when your POS app starts. You can see this in `src/App.tsx`:

```typescript
import { initializeRemoteMaintenance } from './lib/remote-maintenance';

useEffect(() => {
  const maintenanceConfig = {
    supportUrl: 'https://your-support-server.com',
    businessId: 'your-business-id',
    licenseKey: 'your-license-key',
    lastUpdateCheck: new Date(),
    maintenanceMode: false,
    supportLevel: 'basic' // 'basic' | 'premium' | 'enterprise'
  };
  
  initializeRemoteMaintenance(maintenanceConfig);
}, []);
```

### 2. Access the Maintenance Panel
Look for the floating settings button (‚öôÔ∏è) in the bottom-right corner of your POS interface. Click it to open the maintenance panel.

## üì± Features Available

### System Status Monitoring
- **Connection Status**: Shows online/offline status
- **Maintenance Mode**: Indicates if system is in maintenance mode
- **Last Sync**: Displays when the system last synchronized with the server

### Remote Support Actions
1. **Force Sync**: Manually trigger synchronization with remote server
2. **Create Support Ticket**: Generate support requests that are sent to your support team
3. **Maintenance Mode Toggle**: Enable/disable maintenance mode

## üîß Configuration Options

### Support Levels
- **Basic**: Essential monitoring and support
- **Premium**: Advanced diagnostics and priority support
- **Enterprise**: Full monitoring, instant support, and custom integrations

### Server Configuration
Update your support server URL and credentials:

```typescript
const maintenanceConfig = {
  supportUrl: 'https://your-support-server.com',
  businessId: 'unique-business-identifier',
  licenseKey: 'your-license-key',
  supportLevel: 'premium'
};
```

## üåê Server-Side Requirements

To fully utilize the remote maintenance system, you'll need a server backend with these endpoints:

### API Endpoints Required:

#### 1. Health Check
```
POST /api/diagnostic
Headers: 
  - Authorization: Bearer {licenseKey}
  - X-Business-ID: {businessId}
Body: SystemInfo object
```

#### 2. Remote Commands
```
GET /api/commands
Headers:
  - Authorization: Bearer {licenseKey}
  - X-Business-ID: {businessId}
Response: Array of RemoteCommand objects
```

#### 3. Support Tickets
```
POST /api/support
Headers:
  - Authorization: Bearer {licenseKey}
  - X-Business-ID: {businessId}
Body: SupportTicket object
```

#### 4. Backup Upload
```
POST /api/backup
Headers:
  - Authorization: Bearer {licenseKey}
  - X-Business-ID: {businessId}
Body: BackupData object
```

## üéØ Use Cases

### For Business Owners
- **Monitor System Health**: Check if POS is running smoothly
- **Request Support**: Create tickets when issues arise
- **Receive Updates**: Get automatic updates and patches

### For Technical Support Teams
- **Remote Diagnostics**: Access system information without being on-site
- **Push Updates**: Deploy fixes and updates remotely
- **Error Monitoring**: Receive automatic error reports and logs

### For Software Vendors
- **Customer Support**: Provide remote assistance to customers
- **System Monitoring**: Track performance across all deployed systems
- **Update Management**: Push updates to all or specific customers

## üìä Diagnostic Information Collected

The system automatically collects:
- **Performance Metrics**: Database query times, memory usage
- **Error Logs**: JavaScript errors and stack traces
- **System Information**: Browser, platform, POS version
- **Database Health**: Table counts, last backup status
- **Business Data**: Anonymized usage statistics

## üîê Security & Privacy

- All communication uses HTTPS
- License keys authenticate each business
- Business data remains encrypted
- No sensitive customer data is transmitted
- Local fallbacks when server is unavailable

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Customization

### Adding Custom Diagnostic Data
Extend the system info collection:

```typescript
const customSystemInfo = {
  ...defaultSystemInfo,
  customMetrics: {
    dailySales: await getDailySalesCount(),
    averageTransactionTime: await getAverageTransactionTime()
  }
};
```

### Custom Support Categories
Update the support ticket categories in the interface:

```typescript
export interface SupportTicket {
  category: 'technical' | 'billing' | 'feature-request' | 'training' | 'custom';
}
```

### Offline Behavior
The system gracefully handles offline scenarios:
- Support tickets are queued locally
- Diagnostic data is cached
- Sync resumes automatically when online

## üìà Monitoring Dashboard (Server-Side)

Your support server can provide dashboards showing:
- Real-time status of all POS systems
- Error trends and performance metrics
- Support ticket analytics
- System update deployment status

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Maintenance service not initialized"**
   - Check that `initializeRemoteMaintenance()` is called in App.tsx
   - Verify configuration object has all required fields

2. **"Support tickets not sending"**
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify server URL and license key
   - Tickets are saved locally and will sync when online

3. **"Sync failures"**
   - Server might be down or misconfigured
   - Check browser console for detailed error messages
   - System will retry automatically

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by opening browser console and running:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('pos-debug', 'true');
```

## üîÑ Update Process

1. **Automatic Checks**: System checks for updates every 5 minutes
2. **Critical Updates**: Applied automatically for security fixes
3. **Feature Updates**: User prompted to apply at convenient time
4. **Rollback**: Failed updates can be rolled back remotely

## üí° Tips for Maximum Effectiveness

1. **Configure Proper Support Level**: Choose based on your business needs
2. **Regular Health Checks**: Monitor the maintenance panel regularly
3. **Train Staff**: Show team members how to create support tickets
4. **Server Maintenance**: Keep your support server updated and monitored
5. **Backup Strategy**: Regular backups are created automatically

This remote maintenance system transforms your POS from a standalone application into a connected, manageable business solution with enterprise-level support capabilities.
